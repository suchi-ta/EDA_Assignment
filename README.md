 Assignment: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on California House Price Dataset

The goal of this project is to analyze the California House Price Dataset and extract
meaningful insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Project Requirements: 

Step 1: Load the Dataset
● Import the dataset using pandas.
● Display the first few rows to understand its structure.

Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
● Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
● Convert categorical variables into numerical representations (if needed).

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform the following analyses and visualizations:
1. Summary Statistics
○ Display mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max for numerical
features.
2. Distribution Analysis
○ Plot histograms for house prices, median income, and house age.
○ Identify skewness in the dataset.
3. Correlation Analysis
○ Compute the correlation matrix and visualize it using a heatmap.
○ Identify features that have a strong impact on house prices.
4. Geospatial Analysis
○ Create a scatter plot of house prices based on longitude and latitude to
identify location-based trends.
5. Feature Relationships
○ Plot Median Income vs. Median House Value to analyze income impact on
housing prices.
○ Compare house prices across different Ocean Proximity categories using a
boxplot.
